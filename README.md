# Parallel Runs

#### Built a testing project, to test which of the two crystals is better to be used (higher accuracy rate). Within the implementation, generate two instances of calculators with the following calculator: Crystal 1 and Crystal 2.

##### In order to test the accuracy of each calculator, 20 pairs of random numbers should be generated. An accurate result should be considered a "Successful Calculation", and a skewed result should be considered an "error".
##### At the end of the 20 samples each calculator test should produce a "Success Rate" calculated as: 

* (Number of Successful Calculations/20).

##### The output of the program should print the calculations, whether they are correct or an error, the success rates of the calculators and which Crystal is better to be used (the one with the higher success rate) to the console.


###### Implementation Requirements
* Java 
* Parallel Runs (Thread)
* Follow OOP Standards
* Modularity is KEY
